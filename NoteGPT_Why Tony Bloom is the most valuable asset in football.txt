in 1998 I was at the last game at the Golston ground as a teenager in what was probably one of the worst yet most compelling games I have ever witnessed 22 men in a muddy field kicking the crap out of each other Brighton eked out a one-nil win which lifted them off the bottom of the football league and went on to avoid relegation via gold difference um great you might say but lots of clubs have long and windy backstories and many of them go on to have their day in the Sun Brighton are doing extremely well right

now but inevitably it's all downhill from here that's very possible actually it's sort of quite likely but there are a few things nagging at me that suggest that perhaps this club might not just stick around in the top flight but change the game itself looking into this further you have to ask the question have Brighton jump the curb and how long can they stay ahead of the game in order to break this down I'm going to use a framework taught and used in Business Schools namely the incredibly

forgettably titled v r i o framework this model helps a company or any Organization for that matter establish what they would call sustainable competitive advantage in other words what Edge do you have that others don't and how long will that edge last this is the interesting question surrounding Brighton and Hove Albion right now and by examining it we can see some of the emerging Trends taking place in football generally the V what do you have that's valuable this will likely be a long list and can

consist of any asset an organization has let's say money or players or the fan base or the training ground staff whatever the r out of these valuable assets which ones are rare or is it common for competitors in the industry to have similar capabilities so for instance training grounds and stadiums Etc are valuable but generally they're not rare as everyone has them albeit with different sizes and quality exciting stuff I'm saving you thousands of pounds here the I in there inimitable inimitable

straight out of the book of business school words meaning is it hard for others to imitate copy or acquire it for themselves there is a fourth and crucial section here oh for organization if you have an asset that is rare valuable and hard for others to copy it is in theory a sustainable competitive advantage however does the organization or the football club in this case have the know-how and capability to harness these advantages in the multi-faceted world of modern day football it seems more and more of an

onus is on the owner in this regard something that has become apparent in recent years is the growing emphasis and ambiguity about the owner's role in relation to the different aspects of a club and the performance of the team on the pitch someone like Gary Neville will argue that is just about everything when talking about the long-term vision of the glazes others like Graeme souness and Simon Jordan push back on that notion stating that ultimately the players on the pitch must bear at least some of the

responsibility everyone knows that the owner is important but there seems to be a gray area on where their jurisdiction and accountability starts and ends does the owner know where this is does the club know where it is that brings us to Brighton's owner the Fantastic trouser wearing Tony Bloom and when you talk about Tony Bloom you need to talk about data this has been pretty well covered in the media generally and there is a lot of casual talk about Brighton and brentford's Moneyball model and the use

of Analytics but the thing to understand here is data is one of those things that is very easy to say but incredibly difficult to do well anyone who has worked with data professionally will tell you that this staff is as slippery as a bar of soap lying on Rob Green's shower tray data is as likely to produce an outcome detrimental to those who own and act on it as a positive one it's easy for a data Department to slip into the mode that serves to justify the ongoing existence of the data Department

be that as it may there is a private Equity Revolution going on in sport where owners such as Todd bowley backed by groups like Clearwater believe they can find new value by applying modern Financial practice and New Age analytics to sport similar to Moneyball the Oakland Athletics stole a march with their use of data to identify value in players that others could not the problem however is that while this was valuable and rare for a time it was not in the in them in inimitable The Edge soon disappeared when everyone

started to access the data basically the fact that many clubs are accessing data supplied by opta prozone size Sports and many others suggest that the data they are using is available to anyone who wants it pretty much bone Lee May well be right that huge value can be unlocked by Cutting Edge data the problem is is that there is someone better at doing it than they are and money alone won't bridge that data Gap this brings us on to Tony Bloom's Enterprise Star lizard based in Camden in London

sports betting consultancy generating Millions for its clients it has 160 data Engineers on the payroll managing a series of Highly complex algorithms to find statistical Edge after 25 years of perfecting these highly secretive complex statistical models in leagues all over the world you can make the assumption that the data Tony Bloom is using is not the same data as everybody else and even if it is it's likely that clubs other than Brighton wouldn't know what to do with it or certainly not as proficient at

using it so while the general Outlook is that data is vital Brighton who are invoiced by star lizard for use of what they term the algorithm each year are just better at it not only are they better at it the system is harder to copy than it is going into a 50 50 with Stuart Pierce after he's had a particularly bad day it's not a simple thing for other clubs to start using the same data methods here's a quote from The Business Insider from a former employee of style lizard every aspect of football you can think

of was taken into consideration I guess that's why they're so good at what they do the weather morale anyone related to the club would be analyzed under the microscope it was pretty impressive now what is clear is that Bloom's knowledge and use of data has further reaching ramifications for how the club is run other than just player transfers which is what is mainly reported about Brian like Disney use animated characters to drive their film TV channels hotels parks and everything else Disney do

Bloom is able to do something approaching that with data it infiltrates many parts of the club the Paradox of good gamblers is that they don't Gamble they find an edge and do what they can to maximize that edge via a strict system that also minimizes risk it's about tilting the table in your favor for want of a better expression the beauty of a system is that it provides Clarity and simplifies decision making in ambiguous circumstances football is a very reactionary business heightened by pundits the media and fans

and football phones who go on a rampage after a loss but what good gamblers realize is that just because you lost it doesn't mean it was the wrong bet similarly if you win it doesn't mean it was the right bet either we are talking about systems and sticking to a system to attain value in the long term this sort of stuff is the complete opposite of everything we as followers of football have heard one of the great joys of assessing Tony Bloom and his influence on a club like Brighton is that he ruthlessly slays

numerous football cliches as he goes which is always fun here's two examples I'm going to touch on that give you some insight into the process behind Tony Bloom's hiring of managers and how data might have influenced this and not just the data the system that's implemented via the data the first one being his first hire after waffling on about data this is slightly paradoxical as this was absolutely a leap of faith but predicated on an opportunity seen in the data analysis it may have been his most important and

perhaps the most revealing higher Bloom has ever made as soon as he took the reins in 2009 Bloom broke the mold with his managerial appointments the club had exclusively hired British with a couple of Irish managers to this point and with Brighton bottom of League one the obvious candidates were the steadying influences of either Steve Coppell Steve Cottrell or Nigel Adkins but instead Bloom gave the job to someone who had never played in League One never managed in League one and uh in fact never managed anyone never at

all but why because the manager Bloom was looking for didn't exist yet or at least not in League one Bloom knew that teams that prioritized possession with high passing stats that led to Chances had an advantage in the modern game guardiola's great tick attacker basa team were at the height of their powers and perhaps this had some bearing but Bloom needed someone who was going to implement this keyboard style in League one something that a lot of people at the time or even now would have not thought

possible or wise particularly for a club like Brighton enter Gus poye who was given the job after impressing bloom during a meeting at a London hotel where poyer impressed upon Bloom his desire to coach a team to play this way despite having little to no experience to speak of this Outlook was the clinching factor for Bloom poye went on to win promotion from League one he got the club to the championship playoffs before an acrimonious split which may account for the lack of credit poyer has received for the job he did ever since

these were great achievements and was really a revolutionary period for the club but perhaps Bloom got lucky here he probably did get a bit lucky but that's not really the point the key factor is that bloom had laid down a template for the kind of manager he needed and a philosophy that would allow him to attract and Target staff players and an attitude at the club now the criteria was set he had gained the ability to plan ahead and if he needed to change manager with as little disruption as possible because they were

like-minded highly specified Targets in line all of Bloom's appointments since have based their coaching on a high possession and passing game with ball retention being Paramount all but one have played and coached abroad all but one were between 41 and 44 when hired by bloom this does not mean all the choices were a success but remember just because you lost it doesn't mean it was the wrong bet again we are talking about Clarity of system here only one appointment could be labeled as a flop and even here Sammy hippie

attended his resignation he was not pushed by bloom a sign again that he had faith in the system that identified HIPAA as a good fear and believe would yield results given more time what is also striking is that many of these managers had by far the best spells of their careers while at Brighton indicating that the type of manager Brighton needed was perhaps different to other teams one size does not fit all the targeting of these guys was highly specific and often not managers that other teams had

identified or wanted Roberto deserve is being louded by anyone who follows the game as the new Messiah very few knew of him when he came to England no one certainly in League one was caught in poye back in 2009. Bloom was and is working to a different plan meaning he sidesteps a lot of the competition for players and staff who are seemingly placing more value in other things the second example comes from back in 2018 Brighton sacked Chris Newton after doing really a very good job it wasn't clear

to the Casual Observer that Brighton were not doing anything but getting above their station but again this is where having a rigid and trusted system is able to provide Clarity and seemingly ambiguous circumstances Bloom according to this quote from the style is an employee was among the first in realizing the importance of big chances created as a metric to determine mid to long-term success because luck played a huge role in the low scoring game of football results were an imperfect indicator of a team's strength

What mattered much more in terms of probability was the quality of chances created and conceded this is perhaps my favorite Bloom cliche Crusher essentially telling us that if you want to predict success going forward the table is a dirty rotten liar if you look at big chances created and missed through Brighton seasons in the Premier League we start to get some insight into the importance of this stat when Brighton arrived in the Premier League in the 2017-18 season they finished 15th in the 2018-19 season they finished 17th

avoiding relegation once again clubs such as Burnley and Bournemouth at the time would not consider rocking the boat in this way with managers providing stability and Premier League know-how however when you look at big chances created a mist Brighton ranked in 14th Place for the 2017-18 season in 2018 and 19 they were rock bottom knowing the emphasis Bloom placed on this stat was likely a factor in making the change despite Houghton achieving what most people would deem a successful job in keeping Brighton in the Premier

League for a second year running to emphasize the point further Brighton's league position did not alter dramatically after switching to Potter for The Following season in 2019-20 or in 2021 finishing 15th and 16th in the league respectively however on big chances missed they shot up to eighth for both of those seasons so while Brighton hovered around relegation for another two years there were measurably different seasons in terms of the health of the team on the pitch than the first two this was achievable because Brighton

were measuring success in a different way offering Clarity and ultimately at the decisiveness that others around them did not and still do not have during Potter's time it was clear that Brighton did not score enough goals and despite pundits and fans alike baying for a new center forward the club always refrained from doing so but why not just add what is a clear fix to a big problem this is an accusation also labeled at Chelsea who as mentioned seem to be wanting to employ a system to one lot

more value similar to Brighton so maybe there's some crossover here it is an interesting one because when we talk about big chances missed the best teams miss the most amount of good chances it is not a case that they are necessarily more clinical which pundits tend to suggest they are you just score more goals by creating more chances simply buying someone to put the ball in the back of the net does not often solve the main problem which is the team's ability to create chances and does not indicate the real

efficiency of the team this may be one of the reasons why Brighton did not prioritize a striker during this time when everyone was calling for one and potentially while Chelsea didn't either last season there was something else to think about here if you're a club like Brighton and your Center forward scores 25 goals in the Premier League even with the best recruitment in the world it is now impossible to replace them when they inevitably leave or at least replace them effectively this creates a value imbalance that is

going to need addressing sooner rather than later Brighton have seemingly sought to avoid having too much stock invested in one or two individuals and instead the team has shared goals and assists consistently through its time in the Premier League while other clubs would regard a 25 goal Striker as something of a North star Brighton have actively sidestepped this no Brighton player has scored more than 13 Premier League goals in a season and that was Glenn Murray some seasons ago now in 2223 Alexis McAllister was the

top scorer with 10. not particularly unusual you might say but bear in mind Brighton scored the fourth most amount of goals in the league with 72. is Alexis McAllister a good player yes is he replaceable within the context of the system Brighton have created absolutely they are looking to replace 14 of their Premier League goals for a season this is imminently doable now compare this with Harry Kane leaving Spurs for example all of a sudden they have to find replacements to make up a shortfall of 43 of their Premier League goals

nearly one in two Kane and Son account for about two-thirds of their Premier League goals ironically this may be something that will help Spurs long term when they address this and something the very talented Mr postokoglu will no doubt be taking a long look at and I would not put it past him to find a more than adequate solution however we can see the imbalance in these other teams similarly leads never recovered from losing bielsa as it was too big a jump to replace someone who was as effective

as he was without sufficient support in and around to feel such a big and unique void if you look at the total amount of players who scored four or more League goals in the season just gone it looks something like this Chelsea ironically who seemed to be employing or are attempting to employ large parts of the Brighton model have three players who scored more than four goals Spurs have four West Ham of five Manchester United Arsenal and Liverpool have six the world's best and all-conquering team

Manchester City have eight Brighton had nine nearly an entire team who can lay a legitimate claim to being a mostly unnoticeable but nevertheless trusted source of Premier League goals this is also what helps make Brighton difficult to plan and adjust for as the goals can come from multiple areas the point is if you are a selling club like uh just about everyone it's hazardous to have too many eggs in one basket when they can move on at any time so what we are witnessing here in effect is a highly interchangeable team

with a large Squad of players all of whom are able to step in and maintain the team's quality give or take without being bankrolled by a shake or a huge private Equity Fund when a player is poached the loss is absorbed by the flexibility and efficiency of the system but there is more not only is the squad relatively interchangeable so are the players on the pitch many players in the Brighton lineup are able to play Two Three or even four positions within the free-flowing structures Brighton set up with making

the team on the field extremely flexible to the point where no one is quite sure including myself what formation Brighton are playing quite a lot of the time answers in the comments if you will true to form brightner taking the popular Trends in the game and deciding to do the opposite the press for instance immortalized by figures such as Jurgen klopp to encourage his team to win the ball near the opposition goal is routinely used pretty much everywhere to a greater or lesser extent Brighton again flying in the face of

conventional wisdom have turned this around and used it to their advantage their ability to draw teams in and bait this press is very very well documented essentially what is labeled as the magic box consisting of two Center halves and a double pivot of central midfielders allows them to bounce the ball into the free man when the opposition takes the bait and tries to close them down I've included links to videos and articles that give some good insight into this there is a lot to cover so I won't go

into the on-field tactics too much here what is perhaps less discussed is the complete eradication of what people such as myself have always referred to as fallbacks and the transformation of what is expected of a goalkeeper in this sort of setup a huge proportion of their work now is offensive and relates back to Tony Bloom's emphasis on possession when laying the foundations for this type of game with his Gus POI appointment essentially the more you have the ball the less you have to defend why get

great defensive fallbacks when you can just keep the ball in limit the opportunities the opposition have to attack you and remember big chances created generally correlate to the amount of passes completed which is predicated on possession this is a slight simplification of course but you can see how the thinking Works offensively and defensively and why Bloom and has data Wizards prioritize possession from the get-go way back in League one brightens right back stroke Wing back has rotated between multiple players who are natural

midfielders Joel veltman Pascal gross and Casado deserby can change seamlessly between three Center halves and two by playing a midfielder at right wing back when employing three Center halves gives the team flexibility to defend and attack in different formations but despite all this Wizardry on the training field it is perhaps wise for Brighton fans to reign in their excitement here just a little the way they play is of course valuable it is also rare however Trends in formations and style of play on Ever

Changing and while implementing the philosophy and the coaching and the recruitment was quite remarkable formations and tactics ultimately are things that can be copied and or planned for with increasing success by other teams the media pundits and bloggers everywhere they're going crazy for Brighton's ability to buy low and sell high and are praised for giving a master class in spotting talent and recruitment seemingly somehow able to recognize talent that others cannot again we come back to it

this is a system Brighton do not have some magic Guru sitting in the broom cupboard CEO Paul Barber is very Frank that Brighton also get it wrong Brighton just like every other club realize until they are out on the pitch in your club's shirt and In the Heat of battle you just don't know there's actually quite a thin line between the vast majority of players when they get to a certain standard this is why it's not a surprise to see upsets in cups and so forth you pay higher transfer fees not solely

based on any player's perceived Talent more on the likelihood that they will be able to demonstrate the talent they have in that kind of environment these are actually two different things and the psyche of a player is generally overlooked in these discussions however it is the psyche or the mental fortitude to impose yourself on an elite game of football which is as rare as the physical and talent elements Dean Saunders recently commented on the radio that matoma looks like he can't believe

his luck when he steps out in the Brighton shirt like he has won some kind of Lottery he then compared this to some players a bigger clubs who look like they are doing them a favor while being paid extreme amounts of cash the brilliant matoma does strike you as someone who is just grateful to have the opportunity he does and wants to make the most of it there is something beautifully refreshing about him most players have similar skill sets I have seen firsthand some of the most talented players not

graduate to First teams While others probably less talented have the common perception is that these talented players didn't try hard enough or had a bad attitude this is a common misconception just like any other skill this is a talent you have within your psyche and is rare so if the vast majority of players have similar skill sets and physical makeup then what separates them and what are the predictors for this the software Bloom uses is so secret that even high-ranking officials within the

club do not know exactly how it operates what is noticeable however is how often people at the club talk about personality they are looking for players like matoma players who are not only delighted to be there but are desperate to show what they can do the type of signings Brighton tend to make are of course talented that goes without saying but as importantly they have something to prove this is usually because they are young and they are looking to establish themselves or like recent signing Mahmoud dahud a little

older but with a point to prove after not playing as much as they would have liked at their previous Club in his case Dortmund it is clear that attitude is Paramount to the cohesion of the club and the recent signing of James Milner is revealing in this sense touted as one of the best professionals players and coaches have come across it highlights the point why at the age of 37 Brighton see Great Value in adding Milner to the ranks Brighton have increasingly tended to avoid Europe's top five leagues when buying players we

can assume that they regard players from here as mostly overvalued although it is also reported with Brighton stay in the Premier League now lasting seven years and counting the average promoted team lasts about three and a half years that Brighton can out-compete teams in La Liga bar real Barca and Athletico but true to form Brighton have honed in on other perhaps less notorious territories to focus their most recent efforts namely South America and without wanting to sound wise after the event this makes sense on a number

of levels the Premier League is often talked about as being a different kettle of fish or a step up for new signings from other leagues but perhaps the step is not as big as is often suggested particularly for players who show certain attributes also as well as being good technicians with a pendant to having possession of the ball which the bright strategy demands the players are tough mobile and physical when they need to be all of the things that people question when a player arrives in the Premier

League I have seen Casado a few times live and despite him being quite small in stature he must be like running into a 25 year old Marvin Hagler have all been loaned out to the Belgium league for a season before becoming successes in the Premier League and while their track records and performances were good in Belgium they were not startling suggesting that the gap between the Premier League and other leagues is perhaps not quite as big as people like to make out something we often see in World Cups as more Nations

become competitive on the world stage as the seasons have gone by touches possession and passes have gone up to the point where Brighton play in a unique way league position has gone up and player's value has gone up recruitment is good but is underpinned and Amplified by a team that keep the ball for such large periods just like the managers players are not one size fits all who was left Brighton in the last two years and gone on to replicate that form elsewhere it's not a huge list would

McAllister matoma Etc be worth as much if they had been at Southampton last year with 38 ball possession rather than playing a team with 60 ball possession Lewis dunk had more touches than any other Premier League player last year bringing his ball playing ability to the four but while Lewis dunk is on the ball it means he's not having to defend recruitment and style go hand in hand and that is why the decision to play this way back in 2009 again was so key as Brighton have been able to fine-tune

A system that identifies players formations and staff to fit in so while Brighton's tactics on their own are not necessarily long-term Advantage when they are paired with and complemented by their Edge in Recruitment and other areas it becomes a potent mix which is incredibly hard to emulate it's possible that when Brighton had more flops four years ago the playing style and what was demanded of the players was ahead of the Personnel able to provide it Potter gradually managed to marry the

two things helping mate Brighton such an effective team and organization in essence Brighton were trying to jump the curb and it started out a bit rough guy Kawasaki has the Mantra don't worry be crappy meaning if you are aiming for something truly unique and valuable it is okay to go out into the market with a rough product and then try and make it better this is essentially what Brighton have done and are now reaping the benefits the problem most teams have is that while they are quite polished and

reasonably effective at what they do they are similar to each other so any advantage they may get tends to be swallowed up quickly and long-term planning becomes an irrelevance then you see this in the usual bun fight at the bottom of the league so when for instance Bournemouth recently sat Gary O'Neill after doing a great job keeping them up it makes sense they want to lay the tracks like Brian have done for long-term alignment they do not want to find themselves firefighting like they did when putting

O'Neill in place during the season to try and avoid relegation they want to make a sequence of decisions which fit a style and a system final consideration in terms of what could be regarded as competitive Advantage is actually geography Brighton is in a unique position geographically essentially it has the run of the entire County of Sussex give or take an area with a population of over 2 million people Brighton is so remote in footballing terms that it has had to manufacture a derby with Crystal Palace on the premise

of similar sounding bird names and some game than the 1970s that no one really cares enough about to know what happened unlike other remote clubs such as Plymouth Torquay and Norwich Sussex has a high population density higher than the English average and the southeast of England generally Remains the most densely populated area of the country the geographic anomaly is helpful both in terms of fan base and its draw for the Academy with players allowed to travel up to two hours giving the club an ideal catchment

area over the Southeastern London with only the sea to the South Brighton is Prime in terms of holding a captive audience there is also the small or large matter depending on how important you consider it to be of players wanting to move to the area I don't know a whole lot about this but from what you read and hear it's a thing and if it is a thing that plays well for Brighton even for those of whom money is No Object a decent proportion would choose Brighton over London anyway remember people

v r i in Nimitz but we can take this a little bit further Brighton is also unique in a number of other ways it's extremely Bohemian it has had a thriving gay community that has been an integral part of the city for as long as anyone can remember it is home to the only green Council in the country it is a destination not a place you pass through it is after all the end of the country it is and always has been just a little bit different it stands to reason that its football team plays and is run a little bit

differently the club endeavored to make itself the place away fans like to go more than any other when the new stadium was built the local beer for traveling fans was made available for their supporters so new keep round nail for the geordies single speed for Villa and a skinny chai latte for Arsenal Brighton embraced its position in the world even if this went against the Norms of the time now why is this important because in a world where clubs are owned by offshore billionaires and home games

that are frequented by more students and tourists than ever clubs are in a wrestling match to maintain and establish a clear identity while Brighton's has one that is grown and nurtured via its Geographic and cultural routes and you may still say so what it hardly makes them the 1995 AC Milan team though does it no it doesn't and yes maybe this is a little bit flimsy but consider how wrexham our leveraging bran to attract players fans and open up new revenue streams across the world that's all for another video anyway the

point is football clubs are not just businesses they are specifically media businesses the Premier League have a remit to expand the franchise across the world in the coming years and brand and the ability to cut through to new audiences will count more and more I don't think this is lost on the bright hierarchy and the club is positioned again to punch above its weight in these terms how many times you hear Fans Say Brighton is their second favorite team that's not an accident what we have here is a club with some

unique advantages some of them are sustainable and some of them less so what makes it work so well however is that the advantages they do have are Amplified complemented by and rely on the other ones with a specialty and data and the subsequent Clarity provided by the system created by the data at the heart of the operation I think it is fair to say that if you take the top six teams out of it Brighton have jumped the curb if they were bottom of the football pyramid as they once were no one would

think twice with all the huge clubs in the country it is Brighton who are causing waves in the Premier League and are now in the Europa League they are set up for continued success better than any team outside the big six and now Newcastle ever has been and while the money these teams have is still obviously crucial it does not provide the almost guaranteed success it once did there might be signs that with a system as good as Brighton's that they are able to start nibbling away at the Gap that

money creates because what they do is so effective stable hard to replicate and perhaps most importantly scalable just like in betting you do the same things but put more investment into it for greater returns it is ironic that a team fighting for its existence on almost a day-to-day basis is now the Bastion of long-term strategy and perhaps this miserable era had something to do with the Outlook the club now has driven of course by the supremely unique brightonian Tony bloom time will tell whether the system holds

amongst the impersonators increased planning and investment that will be thrown out in competition but either way Brighton as it tends to do has made its Mark and left a contribution that clubs might want to step back and think about if they are to find their own voice in a game that is seemingly moving and demanding at an Ever intensifying pace thanks a lot for taking a look at the video um and for getting to the end of it that's quite remarkable um if you liked it then let me know send a comment or press like any of those

things um and if that happens enough I will make another one uh thanks again and I hope you enjoyed
